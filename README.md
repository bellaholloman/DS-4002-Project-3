# DS-4002-Project-3
This repository contains files from Group 17's Image Analysis Project (Project 3)
## Section 1: Software and platform section
We used Python with Jupyter Notebook. The packages we installed and used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, cv2, sklearn, keras. We used both Mac and Windows as our platforms.
## Section 2: A Map of your documentation.

## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results. 
1. Download dataset from Kaggle
2. Split into test and train folders (we achieved this by simply copying and pasting the desired split (70/30) into new folders (train and test) from the with_mask and without_mask folders.
3. Install necessary packages.
4. Run 'Master_Script.ipynb' from SCRIPTS folder to complete analysis.
